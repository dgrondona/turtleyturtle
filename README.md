How To Play:

  Press space to move up. Try to get between the rocks and collect pearls
to earn points. Don't hit the rocks, floor, or ceiling or else it will be
game over. Go to the shop to customize the look of your turtle. You must
have enough cumulitive points in order to unlock a new skin.

Abilities:

  Skins include special abilities. Special abilities can be used by the key "m".
You can change this within the game config file, titled gameconfig.py. The abilities
are as follows:

  Turtle - None.
  
  Rock - Increases gravity amount while ability is active.
  
  Sub - Destroys the upcoming rock pillar.
  
  Torpedo - Stays at a fixed height.
  
  Pizza - Automatically navigates through the rocks.
  
  Moonlander - Reverses the direction of gravity.
  
  Time Machine - Slows the speed of time.
  
  Sea Urchin - Can bounce on the floor
  
  Golden Otter - Attracts pearls towards it.
  
Saving and Loading:

  In the options menu, there is both the option to save the game and load a game.
When a game is saved, it is also saved to a file on your computer so that it remembers
your progress everytime you open the game. You can also load games that you have played
elsewhere by clicking the load button in the option menu. This will then load a new game.
Be careful! This will delete the save on your file. The save file is only supported if
you are running Turtley Turtle on your on your computer, or if you have your own remix
of this program.

Escape Menu:

  If you are in the middle of a game and need to pause, press the escape button on
your keyboard. This pauses the game so that you don't have to loose a game. When in
the menu, you can either press the resume button to go back to your game, or press
the escape key again.


I haven't configured the game to run off trinket.io (which i built it for) quite yet, so for now, you'll have to play it on Trinket.io.
